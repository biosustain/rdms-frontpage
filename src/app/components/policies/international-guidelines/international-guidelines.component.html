    <h2>Why does research data matter?</h2>
    <p>
      Research data are a primary output of research. Sharing and re-using
      quality-assured data is considered good scientific practice. It allows
      research findings to be verified or reproduced based on the original data,
      and it increases the value of the initial investment: researchers can
      build on previous results without having to spend money on reproducing
      data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sharing and re-use of data are strongly promoted in the current move
      towards Open Science. Initiatives such as the

        The Directive on open data and the re-use of public sector information
        provides common rules for a European market for government-held data.

          >Directive on open data and the re-use of public sector information</a

        , also known as the Open Data Directive, entered into force on 16 July
        2019, replacing the

          >Public Sector Information (PSI) Directive</a

        . The review process that led to the adoption of the Open Data Directive
        was launched in 2017. The European Commission opened a public online
        consultation on the review of

          class="inner-link"
          >Directive 2013/37/EU</a
        >, which amended the PSI Directive. The Directive introduces the concept
        of high-value datasets. Defined as documents, the re-use of high-value
        datasets is associated with important benefits for the society and
        economy. They are subject to a separate set of rules ensuring their
        availability free of charge, in machine readable formats. They are
        provided via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and, where
        relevant, as a bulk download. The thematic scope of high value datasets
        is provided in an Annex to the Directive.
