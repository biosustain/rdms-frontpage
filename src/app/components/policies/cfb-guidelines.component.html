    <p>CfBâ€™s RDM guidelines and policies are based on the DTU 
        guidelines and policies for RDM. The difference lies 
        in the specific considerations we have as a Life 
        Science/Biotech center as well as the unique RDM infrastructure 
        we have available. </p>

      <p>Research data management (RDM) is much more than 
        simply storing your data in a public repository after 
        publication. Research data management is about retaining 
        and increasing the value of data as it is used, stored and 
        reused appropriately; It is about the publication of a 
        plethora of different and important scientific insights,
         through collaborations and knowledge sharing.</p>

      <p>Data and primary materials should be retained, 
        stored and managed in a clear and accurate form that
         allows the result to be assessed, the procedures to 
         be retraced adn -when relevant and applicable- the 
         research to be reproduced. -quote from: The Danish Code

      <p>The following description of retention of primary

        implemented at the CfB is based on the proper and continuous

        and on-site
